# CLI/TUI-only install of Agent Hub — no GUI app, no sudo, no Gatekeeper.
# Installs just the `agent-hub` binary (extracted from the release bundle) into
# the Homebrew prefix, which is user-writable on Apple Silicon. Ideal for
# terminal users and IT-managed Macs without admin rights.
#
# Usage:  brew install xiaoleiy/tap/agent-hub-cli
#
# version + sha256 below are rewritten automatically by the release workflow.
